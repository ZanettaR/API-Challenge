# API-Challenge
Code2040 Challenge 2017

Introduction

The next step in the application process is the Technical Assessment.

After you pass this API Challenge, you'll answer some Short Answer Questions and upload a resume. The final step is a quick phone interview, and then we match you with our amazing company partners! Remember that being selected as a finalist doesn't guarantee you an internship--you still must interview with company partners--so we recommend you continue pursuing other options until you get an official offer.

Never connected to an API before? No problem. We’ll walk you through how to think about the problem and provide some tips on how to find advice. You can try as many times as you like. The API will let you know when you’ve gotten it right. Outside reference materials are encouraged—they’re a normal part of development. Don’t be shy to use Google.

Here’s a great post on teaching yourself, by 2014 Fellow Christian Rodriguez, to pump up your confidence.

You can complete the API challenge using the language and platform you’re most comfortable with. While you could probably work out a way to make the API happy using manual input, we’re also going to ask you to share the code you use—and we’ll be sharing that code with potential employers, as well. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to show you can solve problems as a programmer.

You must complete all 5 steps to move on to the next stage in the application process

About APIs

APIs are essential to building interesting software. An API, or Application Programming Interface, allows one system to communicate with another. By agreeing on a common set of vocabulary -- the “interface” -- these systems can be built and maintained by completely different people, at completely different times.

Github

Setting up a Github repository for a software project makes it easy to keep track of your changes and share your work with employers. To get started, create a new public repository for the code you’ll use in this project. If you’re new to Github, this guide will help you get your project online.

Make sure your project shows off code for each step of the challenge you complete. If you build an interesting user interface, make sure to include screenshots in your repository’s readme file.
